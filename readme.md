Rules for dataset naming

Dataset annotation is on the image name, for example image 0001_0_000305_4.jpg.

1. 0001 denotes the vehicle ID. DAIR-V2XReid contains 205 ids, so its ID ranges from 0001 to 0205.

2. 0 represents the vehicle end camera, and 1 represents the road end camera.

3. 000305 obtains from the original dataset DAIR-V2X's 000305.jpg.

4. 4 is a representation of the car's left side. This data collection includes 6 distinct vehicle viewpoints. The numbers 1-6 respectively denote front, rear, right, left, front of oblique, and rear of oblique.


The dataset file dependencies are as follows.
